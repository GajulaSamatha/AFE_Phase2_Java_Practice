# AFE Phase 2 Java Practice

This repository is created to maintain and track my practice for **Phase 2 of the AFE Bootcamp**, where the Zuvy Team is teaching **Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

All problems taught during the bootcamp, as well as any additional problems I solve on my own, will be stored in this repository. The goal is to have a structured record of my learning and progress.

## Purpose

- Track and maintain a personal record of Java & DSA practice.
- Reinforce concepts taught in the bootcamp through hands-on problem solving.
- Build a reference for future coding and interview preparation.
