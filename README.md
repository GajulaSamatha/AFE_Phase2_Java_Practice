# AFE_Phase2_Java_Practice
I recently selected for phase2 of AFE Bootcamp where Zuvy Team is going  to teach Java and DSA. I want to maintain my practice in a repository here. Thus creating this repository AFE_Phase2_Java_Practice. All the problems they teach and the problems which I write will be pushed into this directory.
I also registered into GFG Java Programming course. In that course also I found basic and helpful problems. I want maintain those solutions also. Those will also shared in this repo but in differnt folder.
